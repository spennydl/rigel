# Rigel

Rigel is a puzzle platformer adventure currently under development. The game
is still in early stages. I hope to have engine work begin to slow down
and gameplay/content creation work to ramp up relatively soon.

Here are a few screenshots of the current state of the game:

# Build and Run

The project will only build and run on Linux systems at the moment. A Windows build
will come when I get access to a Windows box again.

To build and run, from the root of the repo:
```sh
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
$ ./build/rigel
```
